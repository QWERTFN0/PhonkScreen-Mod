# PhonkScreen-Mod
Do you remember the minecraft mod that makes random edits? so this is the same thing, but now only in minecraft, now you can play any game and at a random moment the background will turn on (well, just like in that mod), and screenshots will be saved to the screen folder, so you press CTRL + ALT + P(PAUSE/PLAY), CTRL + ALT + Q (CLOSE THE PROGRAM)
